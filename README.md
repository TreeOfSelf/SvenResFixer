# SvenResFixer

## Description

  Tired of handicapped Windows users haphazardly using random upper and lowercase in file names and directories? 
  Is your Sven-Coop fastdl server not finding the files properly on Linux?
  Are people really telling you to host your fastdl on Windows, or use some broken module to change how files and directories work on Linux?   
  
  Want to prove this loser wrong?

Well look no further, this script will automatically clean up all of the .res files in your maps folder for Sven Co-op, leaving you with perfectly working .res files for your fastdl server!

## Running

Simply run `python sven_res_fixer.py` and enter the maps folder you would like it to run on! The script will take care of the rest and print its progress.
